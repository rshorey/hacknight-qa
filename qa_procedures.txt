Below are procedures for doing quality assurance checks on an interactive website. It's written by a team of quality checkers without professional experience. We're web users who know how to fiddle around with something until it breaks!

1) Find out if there is a tool that's being used to manage issues.
  a) Are they being submitted through github? If so, which repository?

  c) Should you e-mail them to someone directly? Who?
  
2) Get user stories from the developer or project manager. Who is supposed to use this site? What should they be able to do?

ps Neat trick! If you need to test something with several different e-mail addresses, gmail will let you use a plus sign to change your e-mail address. So if your email address is example@gmail.com, you can try logging in as example+awesome@gmail.com. It'll still go to you! Gmail ignores everything between the + and the @.
