Below are procedures for doing quality assurance checks on an interactive website. It's written by a team of quality checkers without professional experience. We're web users who know how to fiddle around with something until it breaks!

1) Find out if there is a tool that's being used to manage issues.
  a) Are they being submitted through github? If so, which repository?
  b) Are they being put into Trello, or some other tracking program? Which one? Ask the team leader for access.
  c) Should you e-mail them to someone directly? Who?
