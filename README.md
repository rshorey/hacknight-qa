How to contribute to this document:

1. Open the file `qa_procedures.txt` on github
2. Click on the pencil icon on the upper right corner of the file
3. Edit by adding lines, but don't remove any
4. Scroll down and click the commit changes button
    - if you run into a "merge conflict," you may be able to solve it by deleting the lines with the weird characters and leaving everything else
    - but don't be afraid to ask for help if you need it!


Thanks so much for helping the next round of website testers!
